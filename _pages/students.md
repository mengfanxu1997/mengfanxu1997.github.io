### <span style='color: red;'>For prospective students:</span> 

I am actively seeking PhD students and Research Assistants. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to send me an email [mengfanxu@umass.edu](mailto:mengfanxu@umass.edu) with your cv, one-page summary of your research interest/experience and why my research is a good fit for you, and the contact of 2 references :blush: I appreciate your interest and for reaching out, and I will try to respond to the messages within a week. In the meantime, it would be great if you could glance at the research area I am working on before reaching out :) Thank you so much for your time and patience! 

I have been very privileged and fortunate to work with such talented and amazing students. It has been truly enjoyable to have our career paths cross.
