> **_<span style='color: red;'>Openings:</span>_** I am actively seeking 1-2 PhD students and multiple Research Assistants (RA). If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to send an email to my UMass email address with your **cv**, **one-page summary** of your research interest/experience and why my research is a good fit for you, **transcript**, and the **contact** of 2 references (**optional for RA**) :blush: I appreciate your interest and for reaching out, and will try to respond to the messages within a week if the aforementioned material is provided. In the meantime, it would be great if you could glance at the research area I am working on to see whether it is attractive enough to you before reaching out.
