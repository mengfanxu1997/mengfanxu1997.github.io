**Prospective Students**

🎓 Ph.D. Opportunities – Fall 2026 @ UMass Amherst

PI: Dr. Mengfan Xu, Assistant Professor 

Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering 

University of Massachusetts Amherst

👩‍🎓 Who We’re Looking For

I am recruiting 1–2 highly motivated Ph.D. students to join my group in Fall 2026. These positions are fully funded, including tuition, competative stipends, health insurance, and travel reimbursements. Ideal candidates will have strong foundations in operations research, applied mathematics, computer science, or statistics, and a genuine interest in learning and optimization in complex systems. Strong analyticals skills with creative proofs are preferred. Prior research experience with demonstrated knowledge/success in the related areas is a plus. 

I especially welcome students who are curious, self-driven, and genuinely eager to bridge theoretical rigor with practical impact in online learning and data-driven decision making under uncertainty.

🔍 About the Research

My group works at the intersection of online learning, sequential decision-making, and multi-agent systems, with applications in supply chain management, security, and trustworthy AI. Our goal is to formulate real-world complex operation research problems and develop principled algorithms for dynamic, data-driven systems that operate under uncertainty and interdependence.

💡 Research Areas

Multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning

Multi-agent learning and coordination

Robust Learning under Heavy-tailed Risks

Simulation and data-driven optimization

Applications in cyber-physical systems

🧑‍🏫 About the PI

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Manning College of Information \& Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst). I began my faculty career at UMass Amherst in September 2024 after earning my Ph.D. in Operations Research from Northwestern University in August 2024. My research focuses on online learning (online sequential decision-making paradigms in artificial intelligence), with an emphasis on distributed learning systems, statistical learning, stochastic simulation, with applications in network systems, security, and cybersecurity. I have published in top conferences including NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, ACM SIGMETRICS, and WSC, with a NeurIPS 2023 spotlight (top 3\% of 13,000 submissions), as well as in the RLC Workshop, where the work received an honorable mention.
