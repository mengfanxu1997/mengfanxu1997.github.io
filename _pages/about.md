Hi! I am Mengfan, a final year Ph.D. candidate from the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/) at Northwestern University, where I am very fortunate and grateful to be advised by [Prof. Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/vita.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) in 2018. 

I will be joining the [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory?s=&field_person__profile_type_ref_target_id%5B411%5D=411&field_person__related_programs_target_id%5B91%5D=91&field_person__related_programs_target_id%5B156%5D=156&page=0) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in September 2024! I am actively seeking PhD students and Research Assistants. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to send me an email [mengfanxu@umass.edu](mailto:mengfanxu@umass.edu) :blush: 

My research goal is to formulate online sequential decision-making problems and subsequently develop algorithms that are provably optimal for addressing them, with a particular emphasis on Multi-armed Bandits. What I am aiming for is to capture the intricate dynamics within the underlying structures with new methodologies, driven by real world problems faced by decision makers and with applications accross a wide range of domains. In general, my research interests are as follows:
  - Multi-armed Bandit
  - Sequential decision making under uncertainty
  - Statistical Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Stochastic processes/optimization 
  - e-Commerce
  - Causal Inference
